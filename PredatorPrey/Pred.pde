  We Need to find a way to let the main page of the program know that 
  this predator has died. So we use a boolean void function, acting as 
  essentially as a normal void x () {}, but instead opperating at either 
  a ture or false value. This way we can get the most simple and efficient
  way of letting the main page program know that this predator in the predipredatortor
  arraylist, is now dead and can be removed from the arraylist.
