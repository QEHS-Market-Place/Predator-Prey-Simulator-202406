/**
 * Preditor Vs Prey Simulator
 Guided and taught by "ArrayList of Objects", By Danial Shiffman.
 
 Brief overview:
   I am using this program to demonstrate my understanding of the class, ArrayLists, Arrays, and objects.
   I do believe that this program proves my understanding thoroughly. I'm not really one for writing
   essays and lab write ups, so I'll let you do the looking while dropping some peices of information
   along the way.
   
Goal;
  Hopefully I can use this understanding to my benifit as I continue to make my game! Judgement Reedemed.
  and also to show this to my bio teacher, Mr Potts. I missed a week of school and I am gonna use this
  as like sort of a gift for his classes about natural selection... I hope he likes a somewhat buggy mess.

/*    ArrayList - An unlimited array, the way I think of this is almost like a number line. You can keep stretching the line
    when you add more numbers, and make the line shorter by removing numbers.
    < 0 - 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 7 - 8 - 9 - 10 - ... >
    Say we wanted to look at number 5. If we wanted to we could remove the number 5 from this numberline.
    However if we did, we would only be moving 6 into 5's place, and 7 into 6's, and so on. Same goes for adding a number. We would just be moving everything up.
    Continuing on from this, you'll see later on after an ArrayList statement, we have <Bunny>. This <Bunny> is whats called a <Type>, it essentially means in this
    case that our type we want is for a class. and the regular "bunny" that comes after means the size of our ArrayList is a variable, so we can theoretically have
    an infinate number of <Bunny>'s. */
